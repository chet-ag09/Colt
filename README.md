Windows defender flags the exe --- FIX THAT!!

# COLT

Colt is a "reverse screen sharer", what that means is that the attacker can generate an .exe file that when the victim opens, shares their entire screen to the attacker while running background.

## How it works
The attacker can setup a listener and when the user opens the .exe file, connects to the attacker.
